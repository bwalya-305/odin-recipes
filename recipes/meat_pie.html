    <img src="https://eatlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/classic-meat-pies-2.jpg" alt="Beef and Guinness Pie" width="800" height="500">

    <h3>For many Australians, a meat pie at lunch with a good squirt of tomato sauce (ketchup) is almost a daily ritual.</h3>
    <p>You can find meat pies at nearly all Australian cafés and bakeries, corner shops and supermarkets, but making your own at home from scratch can be very satisfying.And if, like me, you are an expat living in a country where meat pies do not exist, homemade meat pies can be a real joy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>To make the filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg (2 lb) chuck steak or blade steak, cut into 5 cm (2 inch) pieces</li>
        <li>1 kg (2 lb) chuck steak or blade steak, cut into 5 cm (2 inch) pieces</li>
        <li>2 brown onions, sliced thickly</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>250 ml (1 cup) Guinness, stout, pale ale, or beef stock</li>
        <li>500 ml (2 cups) beef stock</li>
        <li>5 sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2 fresh bay leaves</li>
        <li>sea salt</li>
        <li>freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>500 g (1/2 lb) mushrooms, sliced thickly</li>
        <li>2–3 tablespoons cornflour (cornstarch), mixed with some water</li>
        <li>2–3 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>To assemble the meat pies</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>shortcrust pastry sheets</li>
        <li>puff pastry sheets</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>To make the beef filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat some oil in a large pan. I like to use a cast-iron pan with a tight-fitting lid.</li>
        <li>Season the beef generously with sea salt and freshly ground pepper.</li>
        <li>Brown the beef in small batches, and use a slotted spoon to remove the browned meat to a large bowl. Try not to over-crowd the pan, otherwise the meat will steam instead of brown; it is the caramelisation on the meat which gives a lot of flavour to the stew.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and garlic, and cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the Guinness and let everything bubble away. </li>
        <li>Use a wooden spoon to scrape off any caramelised bits on the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the beef stock, thyme and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Return the beef to the pan, together with any meat juices which have collected in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to low, and cook gently on a low simmer for about 2 hours, or until the beef is tender. See Kitchen Notes below for instructions using a pressure cooker.</li>
        <li>Once the beef is tender, add the mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Simmer gently for a few minutes until the mushrooms have softened slightly.</li>
        <li>During this time, try to remove the thyme and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Turn up the heat to medium-high, and slowly add the cornflour slurry. You may not need all of it – just add enough until you have a fairly thick consistency.</li>
        <li>Taste the sauce for seasoning.</li>
        <li>Add the parsley.</li>
        <li>Set the mixture aside to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>    
    <h4>To blind-bake the pastry</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F).</li>
        <li>Cut out rounds from the shortcrust pastry to fit the pie tins.</li>
        <li>Place the shortcrust pastry rounds into each pie tin.</li>
        <li>Place the pie tins on a baking tray lined with baking paper.</li>
        <li>Cut some sheets of baking paper which are large enough to sit inside the pie tins.</li>
        <li>Scrunch up the baking paper and then flatten it out again – this will make it easier to handle to the baking paper.</li>
        <li>Place the pieces of baking paper on top of the shortcrust pastry bottoms.</li>
        <li>Place a small handful of ceramic baking beans (or uncooked rice or dried beans) on top of the baking paper.</li>
        <li>Place the tray of pie tins into the oven and bake for about 10 minutes, or until the pastry looks lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the baking paper and baking beans from each pie tin.</li>
        <li>Place the tray of pie tins back into the oven, and bake for another 10 minutes, or until the pastry looks a nice, lightly golden colour all over.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>To assemble the pies</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill each pie tin with some of the beef filling, taking care to not over-fill the pies.</li>
        <li>Cut out rounds from the puff pastry to fit as lids on the pies.</li>
        <li>Lightly brush the rim of the pastry bottoms with some egg wash.</li>
        <li>Place the lids on top of each pie.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to seal the edges of the pie together.</li>
        <li>Brush the tops of the pies with some egg wash.</li>
        <li>Use a knife or scissors to cut a vent in each pie.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
