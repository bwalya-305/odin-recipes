    <h3></h3>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h4>DRY INGREDIENTS:</h4>
        <li>1 1/3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp sugar</li>

        <h4>WET INGREDIENTS:</h4>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>

        <h4>OTHER</h4>
        <li>1 tbsp Extra Flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp vegetable oil (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 250°C / 480°F (230°C fan) (Note 4.) Place shelf in the top quarter of the oven.</li>
        <li>Spray pizza pan or baking tray lightly with oil.</li>
        <li>Prepare pizza sauce and toppings. Keep shredded mozzarella in the fridge (Note 5).</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>FOOD PROCESSOR (40 SEC):</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Using the standard S blade, add Dry Ingredients and pulse twice. Add water and olive oil. Blitz on low for 40 seconds - it will come together into a shaggy ball (video 33 sec).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle work surface with half Extra Flour, scrape dough out. Sprinkle with remaining Extra Flour and firmly shape into a ball.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>HAND KNEADING (3 MIN):</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place Dry ingredients in a bowl, mix to combine with a rubber spatula. Add water and olive oil, mix until flour is incorporated as best you can.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle work surface with half Extra Flour, dip dough out. Sprinkle with remaining Extra Flour then knead for 3 to 4 minutes until it's pretty smooth (video 38 sec), using more flour only if needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>ROLLING OUT DOUGH:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dough should be soft and elastic, and not stick to your hands. It will not be completely smooth like yeast dough (video 38 sec)(Note 6).</li>
        <li>Shape dough into a ball. Roll out into a 30cm/12" round.</li>
        <li>Transfer to pizza pan, preferably with holes (for crispier base), or a baking tray (Note 7 pizza stone). Use your fingers to pull from the centre to fill the pan to the edge - avoid pinching the edges (to ensure puffy crust!).</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>TOP & BAKE:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Top with 1/4 cup pizza sauce and toppings of choice.</li>
        <li>Brush the crust edge (just exposed edge with no toppings on it) with oil.</li>
        <li>Bake 12 minutes, until the edges are crispy and golden. Cut and serve immediately!</li>
    </ol>
